## Authentication and Authorization Explanation for NodeApp

### Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user before granting access to the application. In this Node.js app, authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Token).

- **User Registration**: A new user signs up by providing necessary details (e.g., email, password). The password is securely hashed before storing it in the database.
- **User Login**: The user provides valid credentials (email and password). If they match the stored data, a JWT is generated and sent to the user.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: The token is sent with API requests (usually in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`), allowing the system to verify the user's identity without requiring credentials repeatedly.

### Authorization
Authorization determines what actions or resources a user is allowed to access based on their role or permissions.

- **Public Routes**: Certain routes (e.g., user registration and login) are accessible without authentication.
- **Protected Routes**: Routes requiring authentication validate the JWT before granting access. If the token is invalid or missing, access is denied.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Some users (e.g., admins) may have extra privileges, such as managing users or accessing restricted resources. The system checks the user's role before performing specific actions.

This ensures secure access control, preventing unauthorized users from modifying or accessing restricted resources. ðŸš€
